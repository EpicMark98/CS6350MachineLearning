To run the code, please execute ProjectMain.py. It is set up to automatically run the AdaBoost implementation.
I experimented with other algorithms and the code for that remains in the project.
The preprocessing code is in DecisionTree.py. The AdaBoost code is in AdaBoost.py. Please look in ProjectMain.py to see which function calls are relevant to the implementation.
